Their teacher want to select M kids who seated in M consecutive seats and collect java beans from them.<br />The teacher knows the number of java beans each kids has, now she wants to know the maximum number of java beans she can get from M consecutively seated kids. Can you help her?<br />Input<br />There are multiple test cases. The first line of input is an integer T indicating the number of test cases.<br />For each test case, the first line contains two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200) and M (1 ≤ M ≤ N). Here N and M are defined in above description. The second line of each test case contains N integers Ci (1 ≤ Ci ≤ 1000) indicating number of java beans the ith kid have.<br />Output<br />For each test case, output the corresponding maximum java beans the teacher can collect.<br />Sample Input<br />2<br />5 2<br />7 3 1 3 9<br />6 6<br />13 28 12 10 20 75<br />Sample Output<br />16<br />158</strong><br /></p><p><strong><span style="font-size:24px;">My answer:</span></strong></p><p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br /><br /><br />int main()<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; long i, t, n, m, maxm, f[410], a[410];<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; scanf(&quot;%ld&quot;, &amp;t);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; f[0] = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; while (t--)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scanf(&quot;%ld%ld&quot;, &amp;n, &amp;m);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (i=1;i&lt;=n;++i)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scanf(&quot;%ld&quot;, &amp;a[i]);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a[i+n] = a[i];<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (i=1;i&lt;=m;++i)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; f[i] = f[i-1] + a[i];<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maxm = f[m];<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (i=m+1;i&lt;=n+m;++i)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; f[i] = f[i-1] + a[i] -a[i-m];<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (f[i] &gt; maxm)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maxm = f[i];<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; printf(&quot;%ld\n&quot;, maxm);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; return 0;<br />}
